> Hello there! No updates to Nova were made for 5 months now, so for ~2 months I've been working on a totally revamped experience. Since it's now 2025, I decided to publish it today. Come and check it out! ‚ù§

# Nova ‚òÑ

Nova is a streaming platform that allows users to explore and watch a variety of movies. It uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API and the SuperEmbed/FREmbed API to fetch movie information and offers a user-friendly interface for everyone.
